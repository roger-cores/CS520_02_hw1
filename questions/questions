1)
r[10] is loaded with 100
r[10] gets updated during fist loop
hence only prime numbers below 10 will be printed?

2)

should i fetch values from register into register object in decode stage? yes
should i fetch values from memory references in the memory stage? yes
should assignments to the register object be done in the execute stage then be written back to the actual register in the writeback stage?
should comparisons be done in the exec stage? writeback
Should assignments and comparisons be done inside the ALU like other calculations? comparison is alu
Should i be using register_invalid array to mark a dirty register and umark it after it has been written at the end of writeback stage?
How does stageWaitingOnResource work? yes 

When I return true from stageWaitingOnResource in Fetch class, instr is fetched but doesn't move forward.
When I return true from stageWaitingOnResource in Decode class, instr is fetched but doesn't move forward.
return true from both of them
Both are doing the same.

Should static fetching be used?
empty fetch and drf
