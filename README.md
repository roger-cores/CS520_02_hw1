# CS520-02 HW1 Roger Correia roger_correia_hw1

Everything works fine!

## The simulator supports all of the following:

* Data dependency
* Branch Resolution (CMP, JMP and BRA)
* All the instructions used in sieve.asm in the syntax they are used in (eg: two syntaxes of ADD. One with two and one with three arguments)
* All the comparison codes used in sieve.asm (Only EQ, LE, LT, GE, GT)
